<p>Just a couple of regular car nuts who dreamed of driving exotic sports cars on a regular basis decided it was time to make it happen. The idea of cruising a jaw-dropping super car through our favorite roads in Colorado consumed us! Nuts about cars, but not crazy, we came up with an idea to provide an economical way to drive a fleet of exotic super cars. We would garage them, maintain them and insure them. Then all of our members would have to do is drive them!</p>
<p>We don’t want to stop there. Our dream is to create a one-of-a-kind clubhouse facility where we will house our cars, where our members can hang out, enjoy exclusive events and a state of the art game room, and share a drink with fellow members and car enthusiasts at our fully stocked bar. We will also host private track days, tours and rallies to further enjoy these fine autos.</p>
<p>If you share our passion for driving, speed, power, adrenaline… Then we hope you will join us. It’s time to stop dreaming. It’s time you started seeing other cars.</p>
