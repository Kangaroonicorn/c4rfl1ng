<p>Car Fling Car Club membership is the best way to get access to a unique collection of dream cars without having to buy them all! You do not have to pay for service, insurance, registration or storage and get to drive a different car every week! We keep a low member to car ratio (4:1) so that you can always get the car you want. We will also be organizing networking events, car rallies, classes and happy hours just for our members. Once our facility is built you will have access to our Clubhouse with all of our cars!</p>

<p>Become and member of Car Fling Car Club in 3 simple steps:</p>

<p>1) Complete a membership application to confirm you qualify (you need to be at least 25 years old and have a clean driving record for example).</p>

<p>2) Pay a one-time membership initiation fee of $1,000 which covers verifying your driving record, insurance, income, etc. and getting you set up in our system.</p>

<p>3) Purchase membership points which you will use toward driving the cars – see below for membership point packages – the more points you buy at one time the cheaper it is per point.</p>
